# Development-Guide
The main function of EaseAgent is to collect Java method call trace and metrics data.
Developer need to understand trace and metric before development.
* [metrics](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics)
* [brave](https://github.com/openzipkin/brave)

Instrumenting the method base on [Byte buddy](https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy) technology.

## Example For Enhancing Apache HttpClient4.5
User want to get tracing data from `Apache HttpClient`.

### Step 1
Add `Apache HttpClient` dependency in `/zipkin/pom.xml`
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.httpcomponents</groupId>
    <artifactId>httpclient</artifactId>
    <version>4.5.3</version>
</dependency>
```

### Step 2
Create `XXXAdvice` class in module `sniffer`
```java
package ...
import ...

@Injection.Provider(Provider.class)
public abstract class HttpClientAdvice implements Transformation {

    @Override
    public <T extends Definition> T define(Definition<T> def) {
        return def.type(hasSuperType(named("org.apache.http.client.HttpClient"))) // enhanced client class
                .transform(adviceExecute(named("execute"))) // "execute" is the name of HttpClient
                .end();
    }

    @AdviceTo(Execute.class)
    protected abstract Definition.Transformer adviceExecute(ElementMatcher<? super MethodDescription> matcher);

    public static class Execute extends AbstractAdvice {

        @Injection.Autowire
        public Execute(
                @Injection.Qualifier("supplier4HttpClient") Supplier<AgentInterceptorChain.Builder> supplier,
                AgentInterceptorChainInvoker chainInvoker) {
            super(supplier, chainInvoker);
        }

        @Advice.OnMethodEnter
        ForwardLock.Release<Map<Object, Object>> enter(
                @Advice.Origin Object invoker,
                @Advice.Origin("#m") String method,
                @Advice.AllArguments Object[] args
        ) {
            return this.doEnter(invoker, method, args);
        }

        @Advice.OnMethodExit(onThrowable = Throwable.class)
        void exit(@Advice.Enter ForwardLock.Release<Map<Object, Object>> release,
                  @Advice.Origin Object invoker,
                  @Advice.Origin("#m") String method,
                  @Advice.AllArguments Object[] args,
                  @Advice.Thrown Throwable throwable
        ) {
            this.doExitNoRetValue(release, invoker, method, args, throwable);
        }
    }
}

```

### Step 3
Create `AgentInterceptor` in module `zipkin`
```java
package ...
import ...

public class HttpClientTracingInterceptor implements AgentInterceptor {

    @Override
    public void before(MethodInfo methodInfo, Map<Object, Object> context, AgentInterceptorChain chain) {
        // process tracing or metric for method before
        System.out.println("method before");
        // finally, user can invoke next interceptor
        chain.doBefore(methodInfo, context);
    }

    @Override
    public Object after(MethodInfo methodInfo, Map<Object, Object> context, AgentInterceptorChain chain) {
        // process tracing or metric for method after
        System.out.println("method after");
        // finally, user can invoke next interceptor
        return AgentInterceptor.super.after(methodInfo, context, chain);
    }
}
```
Developer can refer to [FeignClientTracingInterceptor](https://github.com/megaease/easeagent/blob/master/zipkin/src/main/java/com/megaease/easeagent/zipkin/http/FeignClientTracingInterceptor.java) and
[brave-instrumentation-http](https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/tree/master/instrumentation/http) to learn how to write code with `brave`.

### Step 4
Add `HttpClientTracingInterceptor` to `com.megaease.easeagent.sniffer.Provider`
```java
    @Injection.Bean("supplier4HttpClient")
    public Supplier<AgentInterceptorChain.Builder> getSupplier4HttpClient() {
        return () -> ChainBuilderFactory.DEFAULT.createBuilder()
                .addInterceptor(new HttpClientTracingInterceptor());
    }
```
### Step 5
Add `HttpClientAdvice.class` to `com.megaease.easeagent.Easeagent`
```java
@Assembly({
        ... other advice class,
        HttpClientAdvice.class,

})
```

### Step 6
Build and run your application.
```
mvn clean package -am -pl build
```

### Example HttpClient

```java
CloseableHttpClient httpclient = HttpClients.createDefault();
HttpGet httpGet = new HttpGet("https://httpbin.org/get");
String str;
try (CloseableHttpResponse response = httpclient.execute(httpGet)) {
    System.out.println(response.getStatusLine());
    HttpEntity entity = response.getEntity();
    str = EntityUtils.toString(entity);
    // do something useful with the response body
    // and ensure it is fully consumed
    EntityUtils.consume(entity);
}
```

## Metric 
EaseAgent use [io.dropwizard.metrics](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics) to collect metric data.

### Metric Key
`MetricRegistry` need `metric key` parameter to create `Meter`、 `Counters`、 etc. In EaseAgent, `Metric key` should contain `SubType`、`Type`、`SubKey`.
Developer can refer to these files to learn how to write the code to collect metric data.
* [AbstractJdbcMetric](https://github.com/megaease/easeagent/blob/master/metrics/src/main/java/com/megaease/easeagent/metrics/jdbc/AbstractJdbcMetric.java)
 * [JdbcStmMetricInterceptor](https://github.com/megaease/easeagent/blob/master/metrics/src/main/java/com/megaease/easeagent/metrics/jdbc/interceptor/JdbcStmMetricInterceptor.java) 

#### For Example:

The application send message to Kafka topic `demo-topic`. EaseAgent will collect Counters(success and error) data.
```
SubKey = "demo-topic"
Type = "3"
SubType = "04" // For Producer success

The producer's Counters metric name for success is [04]+[3]+[demo-topic] = 043demo-topic
 
SubType = "06" // For Producer error
The producer's Counters metric key for error is [06]+[3]+[demo-topic] = 063demo-topic 
```
**The metric key is `SubType`+`Type`+`SubKey`**

#### Type And SubType Detail   
 Metric | Metric Type| 
---|---|
Timers | 0
Histograms | 1
Meters | 2
Counters | 3
Gauges | 4

 Key Type | Metric Sub Type| Description |
---|---|---|
SUCCESS | 00 | Method invoke d not exception 
ERROR | 01 | Method call has error or HTTP response 500, etc
CHANNEL | 02 | RabbitMq publish message to channel or queue
CONSUMER | 03 | RabbitMq or Kafka consume message
PRODUCER | 04 | Kafka send message to topic
CONSUMER_ERROR | 05 | RabbitMq or Kafka consume message has error
PRODUCER_ERROR | 06 | Kafka send message has error

### Metric Field
Metric data output format is JSON.
* Example
```json
{
  "cnt" : 11,
  "url" : "jdbc:mysql:\/\/localhost:3306\/db_demo",
  "m5" : 2.16364,
  "max" : 2557,
  "mean" : 284.19,
  "p98" : 2557,
  "host_name" : "user-host-name",
  "m1cnt" : 120,
  "min" : 0,
  "category" : "application",
  "system" : "user-system",
  "type" : "jdbc-connection",
  "p99" : 2557,
  "m5cnt" : 600,
  "p95" : 2557,
  "m15" : 2.1878099999999998,
  "timestamp" : 1624966154443,
  "service" : "user-service",
  "m1" : 2.0240999999999998,

  "p50" : 55,
  "host_ipv4" : "192.168.2.2",
  "p999" : 2557
}
```

For different type, the JSON field will be different. The detail of metric field is as follows:

| bytes-init      | integer | The value represents the initial amount of memory in bytes unit that the JVM requests from the operating system for memory management during startup. The JVM may request additional memory from the operating system and may also release memory to the system over time. The value of init may be undefined (value -1). | JVM initial memory |
| bytes-used      | integer | The value represents the amount of memory currently used in bytes unit. | JVM used memory |
| bytes-committed | integer | The value represents the amount of memory in bytes unit that is guaranteed to be available for use by the JVM. The amount of committed memory may change over time (increase or decrease). The JVM may release memory to the system and committed could be less than init. Value committed will always be greater than or equal to used. | JVM commited memory |
| bytes-max       | integer | The value represents the maximum amount of memory in bytes unit that can be used for memory management. Its value may be undefined (value -1). The maximum amount of memory may change over time if defined. The amount of used and committed memory will always be less than or equal to max if max is defined. A memory allocation may fail if it attempts to increase the used memory such that used > committed even if used <= max would still be true (for example, when the system is low on virtual memory). | JVM max memory |
